# Cardio Risk Prediction Suite

## 1. Project Description

This project provides a comprehensive machine learning and deep learning solution for cardiac risk prediction using clinical and physiological data. The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of critical cardiac events by leveraging multiple models (XGBoost, CNN, LSTM) and an ensemble approach.

- **Purpose:**  
  To automate and enhance the accuracy of cardiac risk stratification using advanced ML/DL models, supporting clinical decision-making and early intervention.

- **Problem Solved:**  
  Manual risk assessment is time-consuming and prone to error. This project provides automated, data-driven predictions for patient risk levels (Stable, Moderate Risk, Critical Risk), improving efficiency and reliability.

- **Datasets & Preprocessing:**  
  - Clinical data (demographics, lab results, ECG, etc.) and physiological time-series (ECG signals, vital signs).
  - Preprocessing includes feature engineering (ratios, derived features), normalization, categorical encoding, and advanced balancing (SMOTE, ADASYN, manual balancing).
  - See notebooks for detailed EDA and preprocessing steps.

## 3. Model Details

### XGBoost (Ensemble)
- **Input:** Clinical features (demographics, labs, ECG, etc.).
- **Architecture:**  
  - XGBoost classifier with hyperparameters:  
    `n_estimators=300`, `max_depth=6`, `learning_rate=0.1`, `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.8`, `reg_alpha=0.1`, `reg_lambda=0.1`.
  - Combined with Random Forest and LightGBM in a voting ensemble.
- **Output:** Risk class (Stable, Moderate, Critical).
- **Performance:** High accuracy and F1-score (see Evaluation Summary).

### CNN (EnhancedECG_CNN)
- **Input:** 1D ECG signal (length 5000).
- **Architecture:**  
  - 4 convolutional blocks (Conv1D, BatchNorm, MaxPool, Dropout).
  - Global average and max pooling.
  - Fully connected layers with dropout and batch normalization.
  - Output: 3-class softmax (Critical Risk, Stable, Moderate Risk).
- **Hyperparameters:** Dropout=0.3â€“0.4, batch size=64, epochs=80.
- **Performance:** Best validation F1: 0.8387 (see `models/CNN/model_info.txt`).

### LSTM (ImprovedLSTMClassifier)
- **Input:** Time-series of 6 vital signs (sequence length 60).
- **Architecture:**  
  - 2-layer bidirectional LSTM (hidden size=64, dropout=0.3).
  - Multihead attention (4 heads).
  - Fully connected classifier with LayerNorm and ReLU.
- **Output:** Binary or multi-class risk prediction.
- **Performance:** See Evaluation Summary.

## 4. Ensemble and Inference Code

- **Model Loading:**  
  - Models and preprocessors are loaded from the `models/` directory using `joblib` and `torch`.
  - The XGBoost ensemble uses a pre-trained voting classifier and a preprocessor for feature transformation.

- **API Endpoints:**  
  Implemented in `main.py` using FastAPI:
  - `POST /XGBOOST`: Predicts risk from clinical features.
  - `POST /CNN`: Predicts risk from ECG signal.
  - `POST /LSTM`: Predicts risk from vital sign time-series.

- **Prediction Logic:**  
  - Input is validated and preprocessed.
  - Each model returns a risk class label.
  - The ensemble combines model outputs (majority vote or probability averaging).

- **Example Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "predicted_label": "Critical Risk"
  }
  ```
